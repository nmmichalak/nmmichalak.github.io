I received my PhD in social psychology at the University of Michigan where I studied social perception, especially social perceptions of infectious disease. Along the way, I served as a graduate teaching assistant for our 2-semester advanced statistical methods course and as a statistics and methods consultant for the Psychology Department. After I defended my PhD, I completed a data science fellowship with Insight Data Science, and then I started my current job at Lumen Technologies as a Senior Data Scientist.
